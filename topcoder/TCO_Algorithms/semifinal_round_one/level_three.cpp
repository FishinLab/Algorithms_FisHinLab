/*
 * Game with tree:
 * The tree is represented by the int[] parent.
 * Let the N denote the number of nodes int the tree. Thr nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1
 * Node 0 is considered to be the root of the tree. Then for each i between 0 to N-2 inclusive the tree contains an edge between nodes(i + 1) and parent[i]
 * The colors of nodes are given in the string color that contains of char 'W' or 'B'.
 * if the i-th cahr of color is 'W' then the i-th node is colored white
 *
 * In the game Petya and Masha take alternating turns, masha first. on his turn, the current player selects a white node, along with any subset of its descendants
 * The player then toggles the color of all selected verives: black nodes become white and vice versa.
 * A player who cannot make a turn loses the game.
