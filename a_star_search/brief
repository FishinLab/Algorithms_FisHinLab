A* search algorithm uses best-first search and finds a least-cost path from a
given initial node to one goal node(out of one or more possible nodes). As A*
traverses the graph, it follows a path of the lowest expected total cost or
distance, keeping a sorted priority queue of alternate path segments along the
way.
